  "body": "### Background and General Information\r\nI built this application during my Ruby on Rails training with [bloc.io](https://bloc.io).\r\n\r\nIt is a website that will help you manage your bookmarks. You can add them by topic and either enter them manually or email them to danny@app2bdc20b5d5664f50a03f2e8f7c61280a.mailgun.org. Bookmarks can be made public or private. They can be previewed and searched.\r\n\r\n### Design Information\r\nI used [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) to aide in design and layout. It is a responsive site and should work on mobile devices as well as computer screens.\r\n\r\nOne big challenge in this project was to limit the number of topics that would display per page. I did not use a paginate plugin but instead did it manually using the params hash to track next and previous pages. I don't think my solution was elegant but I learned much along the way about how web pages interact (or don't) with each other. It made me really appreciate how easy a tool like [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) makes it. You can really get into that mindset of, \"it must already be created before I start to write it myself :smile:\".  \r\n\r\n \r\n### Highlights on Gem's used \r\n* [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails) for testing\r\n* [postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) for my production database, mysql for development\r\n* [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) to aide in account management\r\n* [pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit) to aide in security policies\r\n* [embedly](http://embed.ly/) for bookmark previews\r\n* [mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com/) to scrape emails for users that email their bookmarks\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\nI need to update the logic so that when links are emailed the preview image is updated. This only occurs when you edit or add a new bookmark. \r\n\r\nI need to limit the number of bookmarks that can be viewed on one page, i.e. need to paginate. I am only doing that by topic at the moment. I should allow the user to set the number of topics/bookmarks that appear per page (currently at 5 for all users).\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nI provide this Web site as an example of my work.
