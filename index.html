<p>I built this application during my Ruby on Rails training with <a href="https://bloc.io">bloc.io</a>.</p>

<p>It is a website that will help you manage your bookmarks. You can add them by topic and either enter them manually or email them to <a href="mailto:danny@app2bdc20b5d5664f50a03f2e8f7c61280a.mailgun.org">danny@app2bdc20b5d5664f50a03f2e8f7c61280a.mailgun.org</a>. Bookmarks can be made public or private. They can be previewed and searched.</p>

<h3>
<a id="design-information" class="anchor" href="#design-information" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Information</h3>

<p>I used <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap</a> to aide in design and layout. It is a responsive site and should work on mobile devices as well as computer screens.</p>

<p>One big challenge in this project was to limit the number of topics that would display per page. I did not use a paginate plugin but instead did it manually using the params hash to track next and previous pages. I don't think my solution was elegant but I learned much along the way about how web pages interact (or don't) with each other. It made me really appreciate how easy a tool like <a href="https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate">will_paginate</a> makes it. You can really get into that mindset of, "it must already be created before I start to write it myself <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20" align="absmiddle">".  </p>

<p>I need to update the logic so that when links are emailed the preview image is updated. This only occurs when you edit or add a new bookmark. </p>

<p>I need to limit the number of bookmarks that can be viewed on one page, i.e. need to paginate. I am only doing that by topic at the moment. I should allow the user to set the number of topics/bookmarks that appear per page (currently at 5 for all users).</p>
